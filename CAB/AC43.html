  <div class="panel-body"><p>After a long and restful stay in New Delhi, it was time to return home back to Toronto. Originally booked in Air Canada Premium Economy (O Class), no complaints there, I decided to use 13 eCredit Upgrades free of charge (thanks to AC 50k Elite Status) to start the New Year right. Today’s flight, AC 43 from Delhi to Toronto Pearson on the Boeing 787-9, was scheduled for 15 hrs 30 min. The long duration would be compensated with Air Canada’s newest product: Signature Class.</p><p>Arriving approximately 2 hrs prior to departure, there was no time to spare in the lounge or duty free shops; instead time was consumed by the long lines of immigration and hectic nature of Delhi airport, leading me directly from the check in desk to the gate. Boarding was smooth and easy with a seperate boarding area and air bridge devoted to Business Class passengers. This was especially helpful since tonight’s flight was at full capacity.</p></div>

	<div class="panel-body"><h2>First Impressions</h2><p>First impressions of the cabin were high with Air Canada’s new Signature Class product. The cabin was arranged in a 1-2-1 reverse herringbone layout with all seats having direct aisle access. Each seat is lie-flat and has its respective amount of perks from more than ample storage space and customizable seat controls.</p></div>

	<div class="panel-body"><h2>Amenities</h2><p>Sitting down, I was met with the new <em>WANT LES ESSENTIELS</em> amenity kit, slippers (introduced on Air Canada’s selective range of long haul flights), a douve, and mattress pad. The kit was stocked with the normal: eyeshades, dental kit, moisturizer, sock, and an eye-glass cleaner. The douve was thick and comfortable whilst I found the mattress pad to be of little impact in regards to comfort. All throughout the flight there was a basket of fruits and snack for business class passengers ranging from Miss Vickie's Chips to Kit Kat bars. That was convenient.</p></div>

	<div class="panel-body"><h2>The Service</h2><p>The food on this 15 hr flight was both a hit and miss. Directly after take off, dinner was served with options ranging from Western to Indian meals. I opted for the Western dinner: Lamb Chops. I found the lamb chops to be less than par with dry texture and simply unpleasant taste; I should’ve chosen the Indian dinner. Later in the flight prior to landing, breakfast was served. Again there was an option of Western and Indian meals. I put my faith back in the Western hoping for a good omelette and sausage. And that was exactly what I was served. It tasted fresh and palatable. From this, I can draw the conclusion that the food on Air Canada is simply a hit or miss.</p><p>The crew were pleasant and polite. Just before departure the flight purser had come to each passenger handing out menus reassuring each and everyone that they would do “anything out of [their] way” to ensure a comfortable and nothing-short-of excellent experience. That was truly the cherry on top. </p></div>

	<div class="panel-body"><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>My final thoughts from this flight were excellent. I can really understand why Air Canada was voted North America’s best airline for the 7th time in 9 years. Out of all North American carriers, I would consider Air Canada to have the best product for business class: it has superb business class seats, they have a modern fleet, and the new introducement of the Signature Suites has created even more excitement among flyers. I cannot wait for my next flight with Air Canada.</p></div>
