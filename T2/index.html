  <div class="panel-body"><h1>Overview of Usability:</h1><p>Usability is considered the ease of use and degree of understanding that is required to use a man-made device. Usability is highly considered when selling, marketing, and advertising an item. This is because the degree of usability greatly influences the user’s opinion of the device; this coincides with the term “user-friendly.” According to <a href="https://techterms.com/definition/user-friendly">Tech Terms</a>, user-friendly describes a hardware device or software interface that is easy to use. Today, many iPhone users simply remove the device and continue using it without reading it user manual; this is an ideal, user-friendly experience. A digital device such as a mobile phone that is “user-friendly” or champions a high degree of usability may incorporate an interface that is easy to understand and easily navigable and has features and functions that allows its users to complete their goals. Overall, usability is focussed on enhancing the user’s experience making it easy for the user to become accommodated to the device’s interface, achieve their objectives, and recall user interface and use it during subsequent visits.</p><p>Usability is pivotal when designing and developing a digital device; this is because the user of the digital device (or whichever product in this matter) should never experience difficulty navigating or unease in experiencing the product’s ergonomic design; ergonomics is defined by <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ergonomics">Merriam Webster Dictionary</a> as “the design characteristics of an object resulting especially from the application of the science of ergonomics.” When designing and marketing a product, it is essential that the user is satisfied with the degree of the device’s usability so their goals can be achieved with ease, business objectives can be met, and the product’s brand can develop a positive image. </p><p>According the <em><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-101-introduction-to-usability/">Nielsen Norman Group</a></em>, usability can be defined by five “quality components”:</p><ul><strong>Learnability:</strong> how easy it is for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design</ul><ul><strong>Efficiency:</strong> the speed that users can perform tasks after they have learned and understood the design</ul><ul><strong>Memorability:</strong> the easiness that users establish proficiency from returning to the device after a lengthy period of time</ul><ul><strong>Errors:</strong> the amount, the severity, and the degree of easiness recovering from errors that users can make</ul><ul><strong>Satisfaction:</strong> the pleasantness of the design when using the device</ul><p>By accomplishing these “quality components” of a device’s design, it will be able to possess a high degree of usability. Furthermore, usability is necessary for a product’s survival when being marketed. The degree of usability and its design is what allows a user to develop an impression for that specific digital  device. Hence, a product’s usability has a substantial influence over its performance in a retail market. Therefore, it is pivotal that the design is well executed and suited for the many functions that the device may have.</p></div>

  <div class="panel-body"><h1>Expert Steve Krug’s View on Usability</h1><p>Usability, defined by  <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/4919/usability">Techopedia</a>, is the degree of ease with which products such as software and “web applications”can be used to achieve required goals effectively and efficiently. Steve Krug, renowned expert of usability, states, “The problem is there is no simple ‘right’ answers for most web Design questions (at least not for the important ones). What works is good integrated design that fills a need一carefully thought out, well executed, and tested.” By this, Krug is emphasizing that usability of a certain product must be well adapted, efficient, and functional for its purpose; a device that is indeed well adapted, efficient, and functional for its purpose is suited for a plethora of scenarios that its user may experience. When designing a digital device, it is essential that the planning and designing process is organized and well thought out. This means that all possible functions of a device are anticipated and well considered in the digital device’s design. If this is so, the degree of usability as well as functionality will be substantially high thus bringing satisfaction to the user or client. Next, Krug states that a successfully integrated design is “well executed and tested”. In the production stage of the digital device, it is critical that the execution of the design is functional for its purpose and well tested. Without testing, improvements to a digital device cannot be made. These improvements will allow the device to address issues that need solutions and contribute to its better functionality. Like Krug said, “there is no simple ‘right’ [answer]” to creating a product with an immaculate degree of usability. However, by developing a carefully thought out plan and adequate testing, the potential for a device with a great degree of usability is highly attainable.</p></div>
