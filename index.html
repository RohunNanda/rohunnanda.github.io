      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse1" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Natural disasters can occur uncontrollably destroying hardware that stores personal or company data. In the event where water is present in a natural disaster, computers can physically experience a short circuit that leads to internal damage where data is lost. Therefore, natural disasters with or without water can destroy computers to their entirety making it nearly impossible to recover lost data. Not only do natural disasters have negative effects on data, but they also have extreme consequences on businesses who experience data loss due to natural disasters. According to <em><a href="https://consoltech.com/blog/10-common-causes-of-data-loss/">Consolidated Technologies Inc.</a></em>, “93% of companies that lost their data center for 10 or more days from a disaster filed for bankruptcy within one year, 50% of companies that lost data management due to a disaster filed for bankruptcy immediately, 30% of businesses that experience a severe fire go out of business within a year, and 70% of businesses that experience a severe fire go out of business within five year.” Therefore, the consequences of data loss by a natural disaster are immense. </p><p></p><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> Natural disasters cannot be prevented; therefore, to reduce the impacts that natural disasters bring to data keepers, data should be backed up on a regular basis (usually once a week) to a secure location or cloud services like Google Drive and iCloud. For additional security, this remote location should not be easily compromisable by natural disasters. </p></div>

        Accidental Deletion</a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse2" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Data loss from accidental deletion occurs when a human unintendedly deletes data not being aware that they have done so. A simple example of accidental deletion occurs when one is creating or adding to a file. Instead of saving the file prior to terminating it, one may forget and exit without saving.</p><p></p><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> In a business scenario, to prevent this method of data loss from occuring, an employer might want to consider training those whom have access or often handle important company data. Another solution to accidental deletion is the integration of automation. According the <em><a href="https://www.isa.org/about-isa/what-is-automation/">Instrument Society of America</a></em> automation is defined as “the creation and application of technology to monitor and control the production and delivery or products and services.” The implementation of automation to manage company data minimizes the contact between humans and data thus reducing the chance of accidental deletion. At an individual level, to reduce the chance of accidental deletion, one should produce a set of procedures to ensure that the progress of his or her data is saved prior to terminating the data’s program.</p></div>

        Malicious Activities (Hacking, Theft, or Viruses)</a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse3" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Malicious activities and data breaches have become much more common today; these malicious activities include hacking, theft, or viruses. If there is sufficient access to a party’s data, hackers, thieves, and viruses can destroy a system to its entirety.</p><li><strong>Hacking</strong> involves using a computer to gain unauthorized access to data in a system. To gain access to data, hackers can take advantage of poorly secured servers, inadequate firewalls, and passwords that are easy to guess. In many cases, stolen or deleted information from hackers cannot be easily recovered. Therefore, it is necessary that cybersecurity measures are taken to prevent cyber attacks and data breaches.</li><li><strong>Theft</strong> is the action or crime of stealing. Theft of data most commonly occurs from insiders such as employees or others with access to data. When data is stolen by those, it cannot be recovered unless access to it is regained. Theft can also occur when a mobile device containing sensitive data is stolen. If this is the case, a system of erasing the device’s sensitive contents should be established to ensure security (when data is backed up to a cloud or alternate location).</li><li><strong>Viruses</strong> are pieces of code that are capable of copying themselves and typically have detrimental effects such as corrupting a system or destroying data. Viruses have the capability of stealing data in large masses interrupting a company’s operations. Typically, viruses are obtained with a “phishing email” sent with corrupted links. Once the links are opened, the viruses spread throughout the computer with the capability to damage or steal data.</li><p></p><p><strong>Solutions:</strong> To prevent data loss from hacking, theft, or viruses, a secure system of cybersecurity should be established. This system should be composed of adequate anti-virus software, strong firewalls, and hard-to-guess passwords that prevent access to sensitive data; this system prevents electronic attack, however to avert physical attacks such as theft or an insider data breach, different physical measures should be taken. In a modern environment, this includes a secure location where computers with important data are stored where only those with permission have access. With the ever-growing problem of data breaches by malicious activities, it is essential that steps such as these are taken to minimize the consequences of data loss.</p></div>

       System Malfunction</a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> Data loss from a system malfunction is considered the most common process of data loss. As defined by <em><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/593/computer-system">Techopedia</a></em>, “a computer system is a basic, complete functional computer, including all hardware or software required to make it functional for a user.” Therefore, the two types of system malfunctions that can result in data loss can be from software or hardware malfunction. <li><strong>Software</strong> is a general term for the various kinds of programs used to operate computers and related devices. Software corruptions occur when a computer shuts down. Irregular shutdowns can result in data being corrupted or cancelling one’s progress. Additionally, when software is corrupted, data from that software may not be accessible again.</li><li><strong>Hardware</strong> is the collection of physical parts to a computer. The main type of hardware malfunction occurs within a computer’s hard drive. The hard drive is considered the most delicate computer part; when a hard drive is corrupted or damaged from factors such as overheating or physical damage, data can be lost; however, it is dependent on the degree of damage. If the degree of damage permits, a hard drive can be removed from its computer to be connected to another. Then one can analyze the extent of the data’s corruption. If there is little to no corruption, one can use data recovery software to obtain stored data files.</li><p></p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> To prevent a software malfunction, it is recommended that shut down procedures are developed to ensure that all data progress is saved when a computer experiences an improper shutdown. Additionally, diagnostic programs, an automatic computer program sequence that  determines operational status within the software, should be used carefully, so that it does not disrupt shutdown processes. On the other hand, to prevent a hardware malfunction, computers should be kept in a clean, dust free environment to ensure that a computer does not overheat. Additionally, Solid State Drives (SSDs), a new type of hard drive technology, are a better alternative to hard disk drives (HDD). SSDs eliminate a traditional HDD’s high cost, are less likely to crash, and are more durable. Therefore, data is better protected in a computer with an SSD opposed to one with an HDD.</p></div>

        Migration of Systems Data</a>
      </h4>
    </div>
    <div id="collapse5" class="panel-collapse collapse">
      <div class="panel-body"><p><strong>Overview:</strong> According to <em><a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1180/data-migration">Techopedia</a></em>, data migration is “the process of transferring data between computers, storage devices or formats.” The migration of systems data takes place to allow server or storage computers to be replaced or updated, website or server maintenance, or data center relocation. During this process, data can be lost due to corruptions during a mass transfer from one storage unit to another. These corruptions can occur prior to the physical transfer of data where old data is read or when the newly transferred data is loaded into the new storage unit. Additionally, data loss can occur when there is a large volume of data being migrated through an inadequate system of equipment. This may result in incomplete data migration or the being data corrupted as a whole.</p><p></p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> Data loss is somewhat common during migration processes, however with correct planning and execution, data migration can occur seamlessly. Data migration itself, interrupts personal or greater business operations and with additional data loss, operations may be suspended for an even longer amount of time. To prevent this, an organized and thorough plan should be created. It should involve requirements of software, adequate equipment, replication, data volume, and data value. Then a method should be created that outlines every step that is taken to ensure a smooth migration process. This method may involve implementing automated data migration which minimizes human contact and therefore the margin of data loss from human error. Additionally, it should examined that only necessary data is being transported which may lead to increased migration speeds.</p><p></p><p><a href="AJIndex.html">Click</a> To Read Further on Data Migration in Aalishan's Exploration of Data Migration</p></div>

  <div class="panel panel-default"><div class="panel-body"><h1>Consequences of Data Loss</h1><p>The consequences of data loss in any given situation are dire and can have serious implications. Aside from losing sensitive information that may never be accessible again, according to <em><a href="https://www.unitrends.com/blog/what-are-the-consequences-of-data-loss">Unitrends</a></em> data loss can have more serious consequences such as:</p><li>93% of companies that lost their data center for 10 days or more due to a disaster, filed for bankruptcy within one year of the disaster. 50% of businesses that found themselves without data management for this same time period filed for bankruptcy immediately.</li><li>94% of companies suffering from a catastrophic data loss do not survive – 43% never reopen and 51% close within two years. </li><li>30% of all businesses that have a major fire go out of business within a year and 70% fail within five years. </li><li>77% of those companies who do test their tape backups found backup failures. </li><li>7 out of 10 small firms that experience a major data loss go out of business within a year. </li><li>96% of all business workstations are not being backed up.</li><li>50% of all tape backups fail to restore. </li><li>50% of all tape backups fail to restore. </li><p></p><p>On a more personal level, losing data can mean losing memories and photographs or more serious data such as tax documentation. However, in any given situation, the ramifications at an individual level are far less weighty than those a professional degree. More common consequences that data loss may have include loss of a flight reservation, student test scores, past payments, or patient's medical records.</p></div>
